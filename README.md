# impossible-color ðŸŒˆðŸ’­

Very quick (<1 hour) proof-of-concept to test [this article](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Impossible_color?wprov=srpw1_0#Colors_outside_physical_color_space) I was reading, specifically a linked image with the description:

> "Most people see very bright colored concentric circles in this pattern, if it is printed and rotated at around 150â€“300 rpm."

I did not print this image, but I did link it, give it an animation, and add some basic controls. I remembered recently reading about the [Web Animations API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Animations_API), so I commented out my CSS animation to try a more programatic approach. The API is pretty nifty!
